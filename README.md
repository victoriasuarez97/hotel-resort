# Hotel Resort üè®üå¥üåû
Final project of React and Javascript sprint from Acamica's Front End Development course.

## Stack

- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/): I used React to develop this project because it was one of its requirements, as well as using React with vainilla Javascript.
- [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/): I chose to use Scss as a stylesheet processor because of the easy way to manage classes and keep everything organized for each component.
